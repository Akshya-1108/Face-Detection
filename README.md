# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project implements real-time face detection using OpenCV, a popular open-source computer vision library. The system uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in both images and video streams.

## Features
- Real-time face detection from a webcam feed
- Face detection in static images
- Option to draw bounding boxes around detected faces
- Easy to use and integrate with other applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV

## How it Works
1. Load the Haar Cascade classifier pre-trained model for face detection.
2. Capture frames from the webcam or load an image.
3. Detect faces in each frame and mark them with a bounding box.
4. Display the output with the detected faces in real time.
